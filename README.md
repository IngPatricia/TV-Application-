# TV-ApplicationðŸ“ºðŸ“º

This is a simple application that runs from the console through a simple menu. It simulates how a Television works with a RemoteControl. 
The source of inspiration comes from it been an university assignment in one of my Object Oriented Programming initial courses in Java.

### What went well and what I could have done better 

The application did run quite well as required. It included almost all the required methods & variables. Including topics such as:
* **encapsulation** by making some variables private
* **static/dynamic Polymorphism** by overloading constructor methods as well as overriding a toString method
* **Aggregation** given that a RemoteControl "HAS-A" Television in the constructor when it is created. 

An example of the output:

However, I did not include a get & set method as shown in yellow on the first image above. As this was realised after summing my work, I did not included it as part of the  implementation but I did so as comments. This been part of learning. 

### Conclusion 
Despite of this assignment having simple lines of code, it includes important topics learnt in my class. It is simple looking back at it, but it took me time to 
figure it out as it was my first assesment in Java and in OOP. Overall, I enjoyed it ðŸ˜€
